# What are we doing?
We are trying to form a large, 2000 nodes, Docker Swarm mode cluster collaboratively. It is expected that we'll learn a lot about the limitations of Docker 1.12 Swarm mode in process. This will help us and also the Docker team moving forwards to have the better scalable container system.

Please follow hashtag [#DockerSwarm2000](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DockerSwarm2000) on Twitter.

# Where and When?
We'll be waiting for contributors to propose at least 2,000 nodes before starting. Please consider to contribute any number of nodes and be part of this global scale experiment. We need your help!

# How to join?
Please tweet to [@chanwit](https://twitter.com/chanwit) saying that you'd like to contribute some nodes,
or open a PR then adding a line into the proposal table and put number of nodes you think you can contribute there.

After starting the cluster, we'll provide Swarm manager's IP addresses and the secret for you to join.
It's going to take 2-3 hours of your CPU time depending on the completion of the joining process.
After that, we'll fill the cluster with large number of containers.

# What's mininum requirements of a node?

  * Linux 64-bit box
  * 512 MB
  * 1 vCore
  * Docker 1.12-rc4 installed
  * Public IPv4 address
  * Port 2377
